            <p>
                I'm currently diving deep into the world of web development, learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks. My journey started with a curiosity for how websites are built, and it quickly grew into a passion for creating interactive and beautiful user interfaces.

            <p>
                Through my coursework and personal projects, I've gained experience in front-end development, focusing on responsive design and user-centric experiences. I enjoy solving problems and turning ideas into functional web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying a good book. I'm always looking for opportunities to grow and collaborate with other developers.
